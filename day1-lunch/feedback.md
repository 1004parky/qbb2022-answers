First of all I think it's great that you're excited to learn better documentation :)

Nice work on the assignment! Your commands are written out clearly and you have very comprehensive answers for the short answer questions. I see that you also googled (or already knew) how to do math in bash for 2B, which is also great. Keep up the good work :)
