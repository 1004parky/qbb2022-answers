## Week 8 HW

Bash commands are in `hw8.sh`.

For part 6, I do not expect that each region in H1 or H2 corresponds to the same parent of origin because we ran the haplotyping analysis on each region separately/independently. The assignment of "H1" vs "H2" is random so there is no reason to expect that each region corresponds to the same parent.
