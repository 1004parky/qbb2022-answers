### Week 6

For dCTCF:
- 92\% of reads are valid
- The majority of invalid 3C pairs are dangling end pairs. That means "unligated fragments (both reads mapped on the same restriction fragment)"

For ddCTCF:
- 88\% of reads are valid
- The majority of invalid 3C pairs are also dangling end pairs

#### Part 2
- I was able to see the highlighted signal in the full data but not the hic analysis output. 
- More sequencing depth gives you better resolution and higher intensities. With insufficient depth, you might miss some interactions. 
- The highlighted signal represents regions where the interaction as found in dCTCF were larger than the interactions found in ddCTCF. This difference would suggest that that region is parts that having one copy of WT CTCF enables.
