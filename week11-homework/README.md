# Step 4: Cell Types

1. I have many plots in `figures/` for the colored UMAP by gene of choice (C1qc, Igfbp3, mt-Co2, Ndnf, Rgs5, and Sox17).
2. I then looked up all these genes in the website provided (http://betsholtzlab.org/VascularSingleCells/database.html) and I found:
- C1qc very specific to microglia
- Igfbp3 is very specific to Fibroblast-like type 1
- mt-Co2, I could not find exactly? But it is a mitochondrial gene. This is a negative selector of one of the clusters, so that would be red blood cells. 
- Ndnf seems to be mostly in EC cells? 
- Rgs5 for smooth muscle cells
- Sox17 is also in EC cells.
