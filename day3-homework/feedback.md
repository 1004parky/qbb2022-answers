# Feedback day3-homework

Overall this looks great. You plotting code looks good and your plots look correct. I'm especially impressed how you handled using a single loop to plot all three color plots. While not required, it is nice if you include the commands you ran on the command line to do these data manipulations. Think of it as showing your work. Your plot formatting was also really nice, none of the data was covered by the legend. Somehow, your ex3 plots used PCA2 and PCA3, but you still see the same relationships. Finally, bravo handling the conda issue on your own! That was the error we fixed in class. Not sure if you were in a special conda environment or what, but you handled it nicely. All in all, well done. Keep it up!
