# QBB2022 â€“ Day 4 Homework: Visualizing Simulation Results and Power

## A
The `probs` line:
- Take a list of numbers going from 0.55 to 1.00 (inclusive) incrementing by 0.05. Then round tall numbers in this array to two decimal places.. (I'm not sure why the around is needed because doesn't arange already return in 0.05 increments?). Then, the list slicing reverses the array.
Note, the `prob_heads` and `n_toss` args are now obsolete so got rid of them.
