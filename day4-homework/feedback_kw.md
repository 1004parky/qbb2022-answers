# day 4 homework feedback

The plot looks great overall! I would note that the titles are switched. The plot on the left `ax[0]` is the one displaying power computed without correction of p-values and the one on the right `ax[1]` is the one with corrected p-values

Very nice code -- Fantastic edits to the `run_experiment()` function!

Please add the following to your README for part C:
> Within your README.md file, comment on any trends that you observe within your heatmap for the relation of power with the probability or number of toss parameters.
